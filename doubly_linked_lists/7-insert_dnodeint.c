 * I got some advice from chatgpt about how to eliminate the need for a second tracker
 * so that I may be able to preserve the previous pointer later. 
 * hence why this code may look a little advanced, I'm happy chatgpt gave me this little trick
 * I think it'll come in handy with hash tables
 * so with that being said, I'll be giving up dot notation now.
